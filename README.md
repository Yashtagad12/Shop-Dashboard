## 📖 About the Project

**Shops Dashboard** is a clean, card-based admin panel built with **React**, developed as a practice project to explore dashboard UI patterns — analytics summary cards, data tables, activity feeds, and trend charts — inside a single cohesive layout.

The current build focuses on the **Dashboard** view: styled sales/revenue/expense summary cards, a recent orders table, a customer activity feed, and a customer review trend chart. The remaining sidebar destinations (**Orders, Customers, Products, Analytics**) are scaffolded in the navigation and reserved for future development.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🏠 Dashboard (Built)

- **Summary Cards** — Sales, Revenue, and Expenses cards, each with a circular progress indicator and a "last 24 hours" figure
- **Recent Orders Table** — product name, tracking ID, order date, and a color-coded status badge (Approved / Pending / Delivered), with a "Details" link per row
- **Updates / Activity Feed** — a running list of recent customer activity, each entry showing an avatar, name, action, and relative timestamp
- **Customer Review Chart** — a trend chart plotting customer review activity over time, with zoom, pan, and reset controls
- **Sidebar Navigation** — branded "Shops" logo, icon-led nav items, and a logout action pinned to the bottom

### 🧭 Scaffolded for Future Development

- **Orders** — dedicated order management page
- **Customers** — customer records page
- **Products** — product catalog/management page
- **Analytics** — deeper analytics/reporting page

> These currently exist as sidebar entries only; their pages/routes are not yet built out.

## 📄 Pages & Components

### `App.jsx`

The root component. Renders the persistent `Sidebar` alongside `MainDash`, which currently is the only routed/visible dashboard view.

### `Sidebar.jsx`

- Displays the "Shops" logo and brand name
- Icon-led navigation list (Dashboard, Orders, Customers, Products, Analytics) using `@iconscout/react-unicons`
- Logout action pinned to the bottom of the sidebar

### `MainDash.jsx`

- Composes the dashboard page: renders `Cards` at the top, `Table` (Recent Orders) below it, and `RightSide` (Updates + CustomerReview) alongside

### `Cards.jsx` / `Card.jsx`

- `Cards` maps over summary data (Sales, Revenue, Expenses) from `Data.js` and renders a `Card` for each
- `Card` displays the label, dollar amount, "last 24 hours" caption, and a `react-circular-progressbar` indicator reflecting the percentage value

### `Table.jsx`

- Renders the Recent Orders table from `Data.js`
- Status column renders a colored badge per row (green = Approved, red = Pending, blue = Delivered)
- Each row includes a "Details" link

### `Updates.jsx`

- Maps over an activity list from `Data.js`, rendering an avatar, name, action text, and relative timestamp per entry

### `CustomerReview.jsx`

- Renders the customer review trend chart with time-axis labels and interactive zoom/pan/reset controls

---

## 🔄 Data Flow

The dashboard is currently **static and presentational** — there's no backend, global state library, or Context API in use.

```
Data.js  (static demo data)
   │
   ▼
MainDash.jsx
   ├── Cards.jsx     → Card.jsx × 3      (Sales / Revenue / Expenses)
   ├── Table.jsx                          (Recent Orders)
   └── RightSide.jsx
         ├── Updates.jsx                  (Activity feed)
         └── CustomerReview.jsx           (Trend chart)
```

All values shown (order statuses, card percentages, review trend, activity feed) come directly from `Data/Data.js` — swapping in a real API would mean replacing that import with a fetch/query in `MainDash.jsx` and passing the results down the same way.

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

The layout is built to adapt across common breakpoints:

| Breakpoint        | Target                 |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| `1280px+`         | Desktop                |
| `1024px – 1279px` | Small desktop / laptop |
| `768px – 1023px`  | Tablet                 |
| `< 768px`         | Mobile                 |

> Note: confirm the exact breakpoints/media queries used in your CSS files if you'd like this table to be precise rather than indicative.
